# ArtBrowser

**ArtBrowser** application was made by me to study current technologies and approaches in Android mobile development. 
The application was made as part of self-education process and has no commercial purpose.
## About the App
The application uses DeviantArt API and allows the user to check for the latest images uploaded to the website. 
It allows the user to select the image and view it in a separate window.
The image can be zoomed, added to the user favorites list or removed from it.
The favorites window shows which images are already in the list.
The profile window displays user info and statistics.
